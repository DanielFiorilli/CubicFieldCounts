# CubicFieldCounts

In this repository you will find the code used to produce the data in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08077 related to counts of cubic fields of discriminiant up to a given limit. The files cubicnfcounts.gp and cubicnfcountuniformity.gp contain code which runs on development version 2.14 of pari/gp (see https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/Events/PARI2022/talks/sources.pdf ). The file cubicbash should be run on a linux terminal, provided Belabas' CUBIC software (see https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~kbelabas/research/cubic.html ) is installed and modified as indicated in the file cubicbash. Finally, cubicbash also contains Octave/MATLAB code for plotting the relevant cubic field counting function.
